Subject: OPT Update - Action Required

Dear Student,

This is an automated message from the International Students Office (ISO).

We are writing to inform you that your SEVIS record has been updated with the OPT recommendation. You must now file your Form I-765 with USCIS. Please ensure that USCIS receives your application within 30 days of the new I-20 issuance date. Failure to do so will result in a denial of your application.

Remember to include the G-1145 form if you wish to receive electronic notification. Do not start working until you have received your EAD card and the start date on the card has arrived.

If you receive a Request for Evidence (RFE), please contact ISO immediately.

Regards,
ISO
